# I’m Bola Banjo but I’m popularly known as Roy

I’m an engineer, systems designer, and a deep-tech fan driven by one mission: to build. My work cuts across artificial intelligence, quantum energy, cybersecurity, product design, and mechanical engineering, not as separate interests, but as connected tools in a larger mission to solve real-world problems at scale. Not only do I write code or draw blueprints. I also architect systems that fuse intelligence, elegance, and permanence. I believe design should feel like art, and engineering should feel like innovation.

I’m the founder of **FohnAI**, an AI R&D company built to protect the future. Our product, **Cencori**, is an AI platform designed to eliminate human error, preempt digital threats, and make security a default layer of intelligence, for individuals, enterprises, and governments. I also lead **ArcOS**, a career operating system for tech professionals. It's the interface for personal evolution.

I’m currently developing the **QuanTonic Reactor**, a quantum thermal-to-electric energy system built to make energy abundance permanent. I create full-stack systems, from hardware and software to interface and vision. I’ve sacrificed comfort and normalcy to pursue impossible outcomes. This isn’t ambition. This is inevitability.

## What I Obsess Over

I don’t do hobbies. I collect domains of mastery. I study systems the way others binge shows — breaking them apart, reverse-engineering their logic, and redesigning them from first principles. Here’s where my curiosity turns into conquest:

- **Engineering Everything**  
  From mechanical systems to robotics, fluid dynamics to hardware prototyping — I live inside CAD tools, simulation environments, and schematics. If it moves, spins, burns, cools, or converts energy, I’ve touched it.

- **Artificial Intelligence & Cognitive Architecture**  
  LLMs, AGI safety, autonomous agents, neuro-symbolic fusion, prompt engineering, multi-modal AI systems — this is more than tech. It’s the birth of synthetic minds.

- **Quantum & Energy Systems**  
  Energy is a philosophy. I’m building reactors that defy convention, blending thermal, quantum, and optical physics to make energy infinite and intelligent.

- **Product Design & Human-Centered Systems**  
  Form *must* seduce. Function *must* submit. I design like Dieter Rams too.

- **Cybersecurity & Digital Sovereignty**  
  The future needs defenders. I’m not interested in patching holes. I’m building AI-native defense architectures that see through deception before it exists.

- **Music, Film, Fashion, and Visual Art**  
  I create soundscapes, write scripts, design clothing, and direct ideas into motion. I believe technology and art are two sides of the same rebellion.

- **Business, Politics, Economics, Power**  
  I study markets cause i must, imma businessman, i have no choice.

**Curiosity is my default state. Execution is my language. Obsession is my baseline.**
