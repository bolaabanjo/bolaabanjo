# I’m Bola Abanjo but I’m popularly known as Roy

I’m a polymath engineer, systems designer, and deep-tech founder driven by one mission: to build the future from scratch. My work cuts across artificial intelligence, quantum energy, cybersecurity, product design, and mechanical engineering — not as separate interests, but as connected tools in a larger mission to solve real-world problems at scale. I don’t just write code or draw blueprints. I architect systems that fuse intelligence, elegance, and permanence. I believe design should feel like art, and engineering should feel like prophecy.

I’m the founder of **FohnAI**, an AI R&D company built to protect the future. Our product, **Cencori**, is an AI platform designed to eliminate human error, preempt digital threats, and make security a default layer of intelligence — for individuals, enterprises, and governments. We’re not selling AI. We’re reengineering civilization’s immune system. I also lead **ArcOS**, a career operating system for tech professionals. It’s a strategic platform to track goals, build momentum, and live with intention. Not just another planner — Arc is the interface for personal evolution.

I’m currently developing the **QuanTonic Reactor**, a next-generation thermal-to-electric energy system built on quantum optics and thermophotovoltaics. It’s a bold attempt to make energy abundance a permanent reality — and to retire scarcity for good. My skill set spans mechanical systems, hardware, software, UI/UX, robotics, and simulation — I build full-stack, full-system products from vision to execution. Outside tech, I create music, write, paint, direct, design clothing, and speak on topics like politics, philosophy, and economics. I’ve sacrificed comfort, relationships, and sleep to pursue a future that doesn’t yet exist — because I’m not wired for ordinary outcomes.

I’m not here to compete. I’m here to create. If it doesn’t shift the culture or rewrite the rules, I’m not interested.
